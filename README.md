# BLEVE_PeakPressure_Prediction

All over the world, large amounts of oil and gas products consisting of hazardous materials are transported every day in different ways. These materials often need be transported through populated areas, thereby increasing the potential risk to surrounding structures and people. In particular, the Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) (i.e. the mixture of liquefied propane, butane, and other hydrocarbons) transportation by road is extremely intense in industrialized countries. Therefore, public concerns of the risk posed by these transportation activities have been growing.
Boiling Liquid Expanding Vapour Explosions (BLEVEs) are extreme explosions driven by nonlinear physical processes associated with explosively expanded vapour and flashed liquid. Blast loading generated from BLEVEs may severely harm structures and people. Prediction of such strong explosions is not currently feasible using simple tools.
Therefore, we are going to attempt using data-driven machine learning approaches to address this problem by predicting pressure generated by blast waves.
