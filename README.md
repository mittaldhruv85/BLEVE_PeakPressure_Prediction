# BLEVE_PeakPressure_Prediction
Transporting Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) poses significant risks, especially in the event of Boiling Liquid Expanding Vapour Explosions (BLEVEs), which generate intense blast waves. This project aims to predict the peak pressure of these blasts around an obstacle in a 3D environment. Using data from 27 sensors as shown in below image placed around the obstacle, we will develop a machine learning model to forecast peak pressure based on various physical measurements and environmental factors. Accurate predictions will enhance risk assessment and safety measures related to BLEVE events.

Our analysis identified key features influencing BLEVE peak pressure predictions.Tank volume, Tank Failure Pressure,Liquid Ratio and Obstacle distance influencing pressure in complex ways. Moreover, Sensor Position Side, Sensor Position X, and Sensor Position Z are crucial as the impact of the blast wave varies with sensor location on different sides of the obstacle and within the 3D space.These insights underline the importance of accurate sensor placement and feature consideration in predicting BLEVE impacts.
