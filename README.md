# BLEVE_PeakPressure_Prediction
Transporting Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) poses significant risks, especially in the event of Boiling Liquid Expanding Vapour Explosions (BLEVEs), which generate intense blast waves. This project aims to predict the peak pressure of these blasts around an obstacle in a 3D environment. Using data from 27 sensors placed around the obstacle, we will develop a machine learning model to forecast peak pressure based on various physical measurements and environmental factors. Accurate predictions will enhance risk assessment and safety measures related to BLEVE events.
